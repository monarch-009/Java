public class Syntax {
    public static void main(String[] args){ // The main() method is most important in java code because compiler start to execute from here only.
        System.out.println("Hello Java!"); // println() method print whatever is inside it.

// Notes:-
// The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
// System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The    println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
// We  should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
